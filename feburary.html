                        What kind of life do you want to present before God?
                        There are many vessels but what kind of vessel are you?
                        1 Timothy 2:19-21 describes to us the kind of vessels that exist and that we are free to make choices on what kind of vessel we desire to be.
                    </p>
                  
                    <p style="color: white;">
                        When your vessel is not pleasing to God then you can be instrumental in his hands. How do you present yourself before God is it in HONOUR or in DISHONOUR? It is just like a plate that is dirty and it can't be used to serve fresh food. When God wants to execute his agenda on earth he looks for a vessel unto honour (clean, pure, presentable) that he can use. 
                    </p>
                  
                    <p>
                        Examine yourself are you a vessel unto HONOUR before God can use you

                    <p style="color: white;">
                        There are times and seasons for everything.
                        There is time to eat and time to fast;
                        There is time to be weak and time to be strong;
                        There is time to break and time to rise;
                        There is time to play and time to work;
                        There is time to prepare and time to manifest!
                        For every season in a man's life, there are signs that announce them. When Jesus was birthed, the star was a sign that announced His birth to the wise men; the angel from heaven was also a sign that announced His birth to the shepherds. To every individual, there is an appropriate sign. The sign of the 'star' was the best sign for the shepherds, as they might not have been able to understand it. 
                    </p>
                  
                    <p style="color: white;">
                        This is the reason why a man must be discerning enough to understand the signs for some particular seasons in his or her life. Jacob said "The Lord was here but I knew not" (paraphrased). There are signs for manifestation of ordination and an example is the BURNING BUSH. The burning bush was not just a sign for manifestation but a sign to call Moses' attention into alignment for an assignment. 
                        Exodus 3:1-3 explains that Moses did not just see the burning bush and walked away. But he was curious enough to look deeper and behold the mystery behind the burning bush. From this passage (Exodus 3:1-3) the burning bush did not burn of its own accord but because an angel of the Lord in a flame of fire appeared in the bush. The burning bush was however the sign that caught Moses' attention and called him to the presence of God.  
                    </p>
                  
                    <p style="color: white;">
                        For you, the burning bush can be something that seems out of the natural. It could be something that you find very intriguing. It could even be something that discomforts you and causes you pain. But it is a sign that is supposed to draw you into deeper intimacy with God because it is time for manifestation of ordination. 
                        You need to be curious enough to know the mystery behind your 'burning bush',
                        You need hunger to behold the burning bush!  
                        Yes! There is an assignment, you know. But you have to behold the burning bush. You need to come into deeper intimacy with God!

                        Sugar is beneficial and also dangerous to the body. Yes, you may say when I am exhausted it means I am low on sugar and I need to add up sugar to my body to keep myself up but little do you know that not all fatigue can be cured by taking sugary drinks or groceries, rest can help you recover strength to your body.

                        Sugar is very dangerous to the body when it is taken in excess in the body even in stress leading to diabetes which is the inability of the pancreas to produce insulin. Not all stress needs sugary drinks or groceries

                    <p style="color: white;">
                        We are in a world where discipline is becoming a very hard task to keep up with. Many fail in this area of life that is why they always fall short of expectations in life. 
                    </p>

                        A disciplined man can bring the future goals into the present as long as he is consistent in what he is doing. You will be short of distractions when you are disciplined and you will begin to soar higher because the sky will be your starting point. Be disciplined academically, financially, morally, spiritually.
