                    <p style="color: white;">
                        There is something substantial that God has given everyone that is different from each person. It is something unique that can't be identified with many other people just like the ministry of Christ (Eph 4:10-14). It is for the perfecting of the saints so that there is no disunity amidst those called of God and for them to bring balance to doctrines teaching and leading men in the way of truth. 
                        Your CALLING is unique
                        Your ANOINTING is unique 
                        Your OFFICE is unique 
                        Your OPERATIONS in the spirit is unique
                        Your TEACHING is unique 
                        Your PREACHING is unique 
                        Your DISCIPLESHIP is unique 
                        Your INTERCESSION is unique 
                    </p>
                  
                    <p style="color: white;">
                        All these are unique as long as you are under the calling of God and you are operating in alignment to what God has prepared for you. You can labour like a fool if you don't know your uniqueness unless you will COMPARE YOURSELF with OTHER. 
                        Many people say that they can't find their way out of certain situations. The reason is because they haven't found their ROD, when God wanted to deliver the children of Israel and Moses was negotiating with God on Mount Horeb about his predicament and his impediment on meeting with God's people, God asked him WHAT IS YOUR HAND? and he said A ROD, Moses was holding a rod which he thought was just an ordinary stick but never knew it could save a whole nation until God removed the veil from his eyes through the miraculous that was shown unto him. It was by that same ROD, God used to part the red sea, that same rod was used by God to bring forth water from the rock, that same rod was used by God to conquer the enemies of Israel when Moses was commanded to lift up his hands. It was so unique that a nation survived because of it. 
                        You are having a rod but the problem is you think it is just ordinary or something usual, you think in that skill everyone is doing it, mine is not different then it is a lie from the devil to blindfold your eyes from seeing the deliverance of nations God has placed in your hands. Note: your ROD is not ordinary because it will be the surviving tool for a generation.

    <!-- The Priest and his Garment -->

        <div class="row align-items-center">

                    <h1 style="color: white;">THE PRIEST AND HIS GARMENT</h1>
                    
                    <p style="color: white;">
                        You are a chosen priest. I am a chosen priest. We are a Kingdom of priests!!
                        Who is a priest?
                        It would be wrong to give the correct definition of a priest without looking back to the old testament days when priests were first ordained. According to Exodus 28, a priest is a man who is set apart from the people to minister unto God and intercede on behalf of himself and of the people. A priest can be described to be the intermediary between God and His people.
                        In the old testament days, all priests apart from Melchizedek came from the tribe of Levi. However as from the days of the new testament, when Jesus came in as a High Priest, we all became ordained as priests. I Peter 2:5(NLT) states "And now God is building you, as living stones, into his spiritual temple. What's more, you are God's holy priests, who offer the spiritual sacrifices that please him because of Jesus Christ" 
                    </p>
                  
                    <p style="color: white;">
                        So as a believer, you are automatically a priest. This is not a matter of tribe, race, gender, skin color, ethnicity or denomination. You are a priest!
                        Now that you have understood that you are an ordained priest, it is very necessary for you to know that priests are people of consecrations. In the old testament days, whenever priests are to minister unto God, they always put on a holy garment. This holy garment which was well described in Exodus 28 shows that a priest was to be set apart as holy; it also showed us that a priest always carried burden of and for the people.
                        Although we no more put on the holy garments made with hands, there is a garment that we must still wear before we can access God. Psalms 24:3-4(KJV) says "Who shall ascend into the hill of the LORD? or who shall stand in his holy place? He that hath clean hands, and a pure heart; who hath not lifted up his soul unto vanity, nor sworn deceitfully". The holy garment we are all to put on as priests in the Kingdom are a clean hands and a pure hands. 
                    </p>
                  
                    <p style="color: white;">
                        Have you been faithful to your consecrations?
                        Are you really set apart from the world?
                        Have you been performing your duties as a priest?
                        Think about it..
                        If you are yet to set yourself apart, then you can set things right now and ask for mercy.
